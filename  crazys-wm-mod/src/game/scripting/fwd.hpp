     * \details This class is responsible for determining which scripts to execute when a certain event or trigger is
     * run. There are three different kinds of events, those for which exactly one script is executed, those for which
     * one out of a set of equivalent scripts is executed and those for which a set of scripts have to be executed.
     *
     * There is also the possibility to set a fallback mapping, i.e. when defining the event mapping for a specific
     * girl, the default event mapping would be set as the fallback.
